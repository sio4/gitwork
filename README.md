My personal workspace for git, github and more.

### Tracker (`_tracker/tracker.rb`)

Tracking interesting repositories with simple ruby script.

This script just clone forked repository into current directory and add
upstream branch of forked repository first, then merge upstream branch
into master branch of forked repository.
